## Creating Data with APIs using Entity Framework Core

This document outlines the process of creating data within an API using Entity Framework Core.  It focuses on handling data submitted via JSON and emphasizes the importance of data transfer objects (DTOs) for controlling data input.

**Core Concept: The POST Request**

A POST request in an API is the standard method for creating new data.  The client sends data (typically in JSON format) to the server, which then uses the application's code to store it in a database.

**The Role of Entity Framework Core**

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) provides a method for adding new data to the database.  Crucially, `Add()` *doesn't* immediately save the data.  Instead, it tracks the changes.  To persist the data, you must explicitly call the `SaveChanges()` method.

**Implementing the POST Endpoint**

1. **Create a Request DTO:**  Define a DTO specifically for the data being sent in the POST request.  This DTO should exclude any fields that should not be directly submitted by the client (e.g., auto-generated IDs, sensitive data).

   ```C#
   // CreateStockRequestDTO.cs
   public class CreateStockRequestDTO
   {
       public string CompanyName { get; set; }
       public decimal Purchase { get; set; }
       // ... other fields
   }
   ```

2. **Create a Mapper:**  A mapper function converts the request DTO to the corresponding entity model.  This is essential because EF Core expects the entity type, not the DTO type.

   ```C#
   // StockMapper.cs
   public static class StockMapper
   {
       public static Stock MapToStock(this CreateStockRequestDTO createDto)
       {
           return new Stock
           {
               CompanyName = createDto.CompanyName,
               Purchase = createDto.Purchase,
               // ... other fields
           };
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Controller Endpoint:**  The controller method handles the POST request.

   ```C#
   // StockController.cs
   [HttpPost]
   public IActionResult CreateStock([FromBody] CreateStockRequestDTO createDto)
   {
       if (!ModelState.IsValid)
       {
           return BadRequest(ModelState);
       }

       var stock = createDto.MapToStock(); // Use the mapper
       _context.Stocks.Add(stock);
       _context.SaveChanges();

       return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetStockById), new { id = stock.Id }, stock);
   }
   ```

   * **`[FromBody]`:**  This attribute is crucial; it tells ASP.NET Core to read the JSON data from the request body.
   * **Error Handling:** The `ModelState.IsValid` check ensures data validation.
   * **`CreatedAtAction`:**  This returns a 201 Created response with a link to the newly created resource.

4. **Database Context:**  Ensure your database context (`_context`) is properly injected into the controller.

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **DTOs:**  DTOs provide a clear contract between the client and the API, preventing accidental submission of unwanted data.
* **Mappers:**  Mappers decouple the DTO from the entity model, making the code more maintainable and preventing potential errors.
* **Error Handling:**  The `ModelState.IsValid` check prevents invalid data from being saved.
* **`CreatedAtAction`:**  This is a best practice for creating resources, providing a link to the newly created resource.
* **Explicit `SaveChanges`:**  The code now explicitly calls `SaveChanges()`, ensuring the data is persisted to the database.

This revised approach is more robust, maintainable, and follows best practices for API development. Remember to adapt the code to your specific project structure and data models.  Thorough testing is essential to ensure the functionality and correctness of the implementation.
