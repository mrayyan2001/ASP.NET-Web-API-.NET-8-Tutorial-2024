## Enhancing Comments with User Attribution

This document outlines the process of integrating user information into a comment system, enabling the display of usernames alongside comments. This enhancement adds a layer of context and personality to user interactions, particularly for humorous or "troll" comments.

### Implementation Steps

1.  **User Integration in Comment Creation:**

    *   **Objective:** Associate the currently logged-in user with each new comment.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Dependency Injection:** Inject the `UserManager` into the `CommentController` to access user data.
        *   **User Retrieval:** Within the comment creation process, retrieve the username from the claims extension.
        *   **User Lookup:** Use the `UserManager` to find the user in the database based on the retrieved username.
        *   **Comment Model Modification:** Before saving the comment, populate the `AppUserId` property of the `CommentModel` with the ID of the retrieved user. This establishes the one-to-one relationship between comments and users.

2.  **Data Retrieval with Includes:**

    *   **Objective:** Ensure that user information is included when retrieving comments.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Comment Repository:** Modify the `GetAllAsync` and `GetByIdAsync` methods in the `CommentRepository` to include the `AppUser` using the `Include` method. This ensures that the user data is fetched along with the comment data.
        *   **Stock Repository (Nested User):** For scenarios where comments are nested within other objects (e.g., comments associated with a stock), use the `ThenInclude` method in the `StockRepository` to include the `AppUser` within the comments. This handles the nested relationship.

3.  **Data Transfer Object (DTO) Updates:**

    *   **Objective:** Modify the data structure to include the username.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Comment DTO:** Add a `CreatedBy` property (string) to the `CommentDto` to store the username. Initialize it with an empty string to avoid null reference errors.
        *   **Comment Mapper:** Update the comment mapper to populate the `CreatedBy` property of the `CommentDto` with the username from the `AppUser` associated with the comment.

4.  **Controller Adjustments:**

    *   **Objective:** Ensure the correct data is returned.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Stock Controller:** Ensure the `GetAll` method in the `StockController` returns a `StockDto` instead of the raw data. Add a `ToList()` method to the query to ensure the data is properly materialized.

### Testing and Verification

1.  **Authentication:** Ensure the user is logged in and has a valid authentication token.
2.  **Comment Creation:** Create a new comment through the API.
3.  **Data Retrieval:** Retrieve the comment or the parent object (e.g., stock) containing the comment.
4.  **Verification:** Verify that the `CreatedBy` property in the returned data contains the correct username of the user who created the comment.

### Conclusion

By implementing these steps, the comment system now displays the username of the comment creator, enhancing user engagement and providing valuable context to the comments. This approach leverages existing infrastructure and minimizes code changes while delivering a significant improvement to the user experience.
