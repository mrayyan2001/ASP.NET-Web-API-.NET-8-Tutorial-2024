Okay, here's a breakdown of the technical concepts and their definitions from the provided subtitle:

**Concepts and Definitions:**

*   **Data Validation:** The process of ensuring that data conforms to defined formats, types, and constraints, preventing incorrect or malicious data from being processed.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of defined rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.
*   **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** A reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.
*   **URL Constraints (Route Constraints):** Restrictions placed on the parameters within a URL to ensure they conform to specific types or patterns (e.g., requiring an integer).
*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight, human-readable data-interchange format used for transmitting data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs.
*   **.NET Core:** A cross-platform, open-source, managed software framework for the Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.
*   **Controller (in .NET Core):** A component in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern that handles user input and interacts with the model to prepare data for the view.
*   **String:** A sequence of characters.
*   **Integer (INT):** A whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero.
*   **Object:** A data structure that contains data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods).
*   **HTTP GET:** A request method to retrieve data from a server.
*   **Annotation:** A form of metadata that provides supplemental information about a program.
*   **Simple Types:** Basic data types such as integers, strings, booleans, etc.
*   **Complex Types:** Data types that are composed of multiple simple types or other complex types, often represented as objects or structures.
*   **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** An object that carries data between processes. It reduces the number of method calls by transferring multiple values at once.
*   **VSS Code (Visual Studio Code):** A source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
*   **Properties:** A member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field.
*   **Data Validation Annotations:** Attributes added to properties in a class to specify validation rules (e.g., required, minimum length, maximum length).
*   **Model:** The data and business logic of an application.
*   **Namespace:** A declarative region that provides a way to keep one set of names separate from another.
*   **Properties:** A member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field.
*   **Component Model Data Annotations:** A namespace in .NET that provides attributes for defining data validation rules.
*   **Required Attribute:** A data annotation that specifies that a property must have a value.
*   **Min Length Attribute:** A data annotation that specifies the minimum length of a string or array property.
*   **Max Length Attribute:** A data annotation that specifies the maximum length of a string or array property.
*   **Range Attribute:** A data annotation that specifies the minimum and maximum values for a numeric property.
*   **Model State:** An object that contains the state of the model during model binding and validation. It indicates whether there are any validation errors.
*   **Controller Base:** A base class for creating MVC controller.
*   **Bad Request:** An HTTP response status code indicating that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error.
*   **HTTP Post:** A request method to send data to a server to create or update a resource.
*   **HTTP Put:** A request method to send data to a server to update a resource.
*   **Endpoint:** A specific URL that an API exposes.
*   **Net Watch Run:** A .NET CLI command that automatically restarts the application when changes are made to the source code.
*   **404 Error:** An HTTP response status code indicating that the server cannot find the requested resource.
