Okay, here's a breakdown of the technical concepts and their definitions from the provided subtitle:

**Concepts and Definitions:**

*   **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A JSON-based open standard (RFC 7519) for creating access tokens that assert claims. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs.
*   **Validation:** The process of checking if data meets certain criteria or rules. In the context of JWTs, validation ensures the token is properly signed, has not expired, and is issued by a trusted source.
*   **Generation:** The process of creating or producing something. In this context, it refers to the creation of JWTs.
*   **Service:** A self-contained unit of functionality that performs a specific task. In this context, it refers to a software component responsible for generating JWTs.
*   **Identity (in the context of authentication/authorization):** A service or system responsible for managing user authentication and authorization.
*   **Claims:** Statements about an entity (typically a user) that can be used for authorization and other purposes. Claims are key-value pairs that provide information about the user, such as their roles, permissions, or other attributes.
*   **Roles:** A predefined set of permissions or privileges assigned to a user or group. Roles are a common way to manage access control in applications.
*   **Database:** An organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
*   **Microsoft (in the context of claims/roles):** Refers to Microsoft's shift towards claims-based identity management in its technologies.
*   **Server:** A computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
*   **Key-Value Pairs:** A data structure that consists of a key and its associated value. Claims are often represented as key-value pairs.
*   **Request (HTTP Request):** A message sent from a client to a server to request a resource or action.
*   **Endpoint:** A specific URL or entry point in an API that allows clients to access a particular resource or functionality.
*   **HTTP Context:** An object that provides access to information about the current HTTP request and response.
*   **Claims Principal:** A class in .NET that represents the identity of a user, along with a collection of claims associated with that user. It encapsulates the user's identity and authorization information.
*   **Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
*   **Authorization:** The process of determining whether a user or system has permission to access a particular resource or perform a specific action.
*   **VS Code (Visual Studio Code):** A popular source code editor developed by Microsoft.
*   **Interface (in programming):** A contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement.
*   **Method (in programming):** A block of code that performs a specific task.
*   **App User:** A class or object representing a user within the application.
*   **Constructor (in programming):** A special method that is called when an object is created.
*   **IConfiguration (in .NET):** An interface in .NET that provides access to configuration settings from various sources, such as appsettings.json files.
*   **appsettings.json:** A configuration file in .NET applications that stores application settings, such as connection strings, API keys, and other configuration values.
*   **Symmetric Security Key:** A secret key used for both encryption and decryption. In the context of JWTs, it's used to sign the token and ensure its integrity.
*   **Encoding (in programming):** The process of converting data from one format to another. In this context, it refers to converting a string into a byte array.
*   **Bytes:** A unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits.
*   **Integrity (in the context of security):** Ensuring that data has not been tampered with or corrupted.
*   **JWT Registered Claim Names:** A set of predefined claim names in the JWT specification, such as "email," "username," and "issuer."
*   **Given Name:** A claim that represents the given name or username of the user.
*   **Signing Credentials:** An object that contains the key and algorithm used to sign a JWT.
*   **Security Algorithm:** An algorithm used for encryption and decryption. In the context of JWTs, it specifies the algorithm used to sign the token.
*   **HMAC SHA512:** A hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) algorithm that uses the SHA-512 hash function. It's a common algorithm for signing JWTs.
*   **Signature (in the context of JWTs):** A cryptographic hash of the JWT header and payload, signed with the secret key. It ensures the integrity of the token.
*   **Security Token Descriptor:** An object that contains the claims, signing credentials, and other information needed to create a JWT.
*   **Claims Identity:** A class in .NET that represents the identity of a user, along with a collection of claims associated with that user.
*   **Issuer:** The entity that issued the JWT.
*   **Audience:** The intended recipient of the JWT.
*   **Token Handler:** A class that provides methods for creating, validating, and parsing JWTs.
*   **Dependency Injection:** A design pattern in which dependencies are provided to a class or function instead of being created internally.
*   **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** An object that is used to transfer data between layers of an application.
*   **.NET:** A software framework developed by Microsoft.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.
*   **Cold Restart:** A complete restart of a system, including shutting down and then powering back on.
*   **CD (Change Directory):** A command-line command used to navigate between directories in a file system.
*   **.NET Watch Run:** A command-line command in .NET that automatically restarts the application when changes are detected in the source code.
*   **JWT Decode:** A tool or website used to decode and inspect the contents of a JWT.
