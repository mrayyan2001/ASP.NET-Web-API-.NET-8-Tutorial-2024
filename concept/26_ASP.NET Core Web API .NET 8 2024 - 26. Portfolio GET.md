Okay, here's a breakdown of the technical concepts and their definitions from the provided subtitle:

*   **Many-to-Many Relationships:** A database relationship where one record in a table can relate to many records in another table, and vice versa.
*   **Database:** A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
*   **CRUD:** An acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations performed on data in a database.
*   **Join Table:** A database table that contains foreign keys referencing two or more other tables. It is used to implement many-to-many relationships.
*   **Pseudo Code:** A notation resembling a simplified programming language, used in program design.
*   **Claims:** Statements about a user (e.g., username, email) that are packaged within a security token. Used for authentication and authorization.
*   **User ID:** A unique identifier assigned to a user within a system or database.
*   **Stock ID:** A unique identifier assigned to a stock within a system or database.
*   **.NET Framework Core (EF Core):** A lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework object-relational mapper (ORM) technology.
*   **VS Code:** Visual Studio Code, a source code editor developed by Microsoft.
*   **Controllers:** In the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, controllers handle user input and update the model and/or view.
*   **API Endpoint:** A specific URL that an API exposes for clients to access its services.
*   **Controller Base:** A base class in ASP.NET Core for creating API controllers. It provides common functionality such as access to the HTTP context.
*   **API Controller Attribute:** An attribute in ASP.NET Core that marks a class as an API controller, enabling features like automatic model validation.
*   **Constructor:** A special method in a class that is called when an object of that class is created. It is used to initialize the object's state.
*   **User Manager:** A service in ASP.NET Core Identity for managing users, including creating, updating, and deleting users.
*   **App User:** A custom user class that inherits from IdentityUser in ASP.NET Core Identity. It represents a user in the application.
*   **Stock Repository:** A component responsible for data access operations related to stocks. It typically encapsulates the logic for querying and updating stock data in the database.
*   **Private Readonly:** A field modifier in C# that indicates the field can only be assigned a value in the constructor of the class and cannot be modified afterwards.
*   **GET (HTTP Method):** An HTTP method used to retrieve data from a server.
*   **Authorize:** A mechanism to control access to resources based on user authentication and authorization.
*   **IAction Result:** An interface in ASP.NET Core that represents the result of an action method in a controller.
*   **HTTP Context:** An object that encapsulates all HTTP-specific information about an individual HTTP request.
*   **Claims Principal:** Represents a user's identity, including the claims associated with that user.
*   **Extension Folder:** A directory in a project that contains extension methods, which add new functionality to existing types without modifying them.
*   **Claims Extensions:** Extension methods that provide convenient ways to access claims from a ClaimsPrincipal object.
*   **Static:** A keyword in C# that indicates a member belongs to the type itself rather than to an instance of the type.
*   **Claims Principle:** An object that represents a user's identity, including the claims associated with that user.
*   **HTTP:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the underlying protocol of the web.
*   **HTTPS:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption.
*   **Token Service:** A component responsible for generating security tokens, such as JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), for authentication and authorization.
*   **Find By Name Async:** An asynchronous method in the UserManager class that retrieves a user by their username.
*   **I Portfolio Repository:** An interface defining the contract for a repository that manages user portfolio data.
*   **Async/Await:** Keywords in C# used for asynchronous programming, allowing non-blocking execution of code.
*   **Application DB Context:** A class that represents a session with the database and allows you to query and save data.
*   **LINQ (Language Integrated Query):** A set of features in .NET that allows you to write queries against various data sources using a unified syntax.
*   **Select (LINQ):** A LINQ operator that projects each element of a sequence into a new form. It's similar to the `map` function in JavaScript.
*   **To List Async:** An asynchronous method that converts an IEnumerable sequence to a List.
*   **Dependency Injection:** A design pattern in which dependencies are provided to a class rather than the class creating them itself.
*   **Program.cs:** The entry point of a .NET application.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs.
*   **RESTful APIs:** An architectural style for designing networked applications. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs):** A JSON-based open standard (RFC 7519) for creating access tokens.
