* **Visual Studio Code:** A free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.  It supports a wide range of programming languages and has a vast ecosystem of extensions.

* **.NET Runtime:** The execution environment for .NET applications. It provides the necessary services for running code written in .NET languages.

* **Visual Studio:** An integrated development environment (IDE) by Microsoft for building various types of applications, including .NET applications.  It offers more advanced features than Visual Studio Code.

* **SQL Server:** A relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft.  It's used to store and manage data in a structured format.

* **SQL Server Express:** A free edition of SQL Server, suitable for development and small-scale deployments.

* **SQL Management Studio (SSMS):** A graphical tool for managing and administering SQL Server databases.

* **Azure Data Studio:** A cross-platform database tool for working with various database systems, including SQL Server.

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs), often used for creating single-page applications (SPAs).

* **API Endpoint:** A specific URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that an application uses to access a particular resource or function of an API.

* **GitHub:** A web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on software development projects using Git version control.

* **.NET CLI (Command Line Interface):** A command-line tool for building, running, and managing .NET applications.  `dotnet new`, `dotnet watch run` are examples of its commands.

* **`dotnet new webapi -o API`:** A .NET CLI command to create a new Web API project in a folder named "API".  The `-o` flag specifies the output directory.

* **`dotnet watch run`:** A .NET CLI command to run a .NET application and automatically restart it whenever changes are made to the code.

* **Swagger/OpenAPI:** A specification and set of tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful web services.  It provides an interactive interface for testing API endpoints.

* **`program.cs`:** The entry point file for a .NET application. It configures the application's services and the request pipeline.

* **Dependency Injection:** A software design pattern that implements loose coupling by decoupling the creation and use of objects.

* **Middleware:** Software components that handle requests and responses in an HTTP pipeline.

* **HTTP Request Pipeline:** The sequence of steps that a request goes through before reaching the application and after the application generates a response.

* **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete):** The four basic functions of persistent storage.

* **GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE:** HTTP methods used to perform CRUD operations on resources.

* **NuGet:** A package manager for .NET.  It allows developers to easily install and manage third-party libraries and tools.

* **Prettier:** A code formatter that automatically formats code to improve readability and consistency.

* **C# Extension Pack:** A Visual Studio Code extension that adds various features for C# development.
