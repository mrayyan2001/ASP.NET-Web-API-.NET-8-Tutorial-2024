Concepts and Definitions:

* **Synchronous Code:** Code that executes sequentially, where each operation must complete before the next one begins.  This can lead to performance bottlenecks when waiting for slow operations like database or network calls.

* **Asynchronous Code (Async):** Code that allows multiple operations to run concurrently, without blocking each other. This improves performance by overlapping I/O-bound operations (like database or network calls) with other computations.

* **Database Calls:** Requests made by an application to a database management system to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data.

* **Network Calls:** Requests made by an application to a remote server or service over a network.

* **Task (in C#):** A data structure representing an asynchronous operation. It encapsulates the result of an asynchronous operation, which may not be immediately available.

* **Await (in C#):** A keyword used in asynchronous C# code to pause execution of a method until an awaited task completes.  It doesn't block the thread; instead, it allows other tasks to run.

* **Coroutine (in the context of async/await):** A function that can be paused and resumed, enabling asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.  `await` implicitly uses coroutines.

* **Yield (in the context of async/await):**  The mechanism by which a coroutine pauses execution and returns control to the caller, allowing other tasks to run.  The coroutine resumes execution later when the awaited task completes.

* **Async Keyword (in C#):**  A keyword used to mark a method as asynchronous.  It signals to the compiler that the method will use `await` and may involve asynchronous operations.  It doesn't inherently make the code asynchronous; `await` is required for that.

* **Controller (in the context of a web application):** A component in a web application framework (like ASP.NET) that handles incoming requests and interacts with models and views to generate responses.

* **.NET Framework:** A software framework developed by Microsoft for building and running applications on Windows.  It provides a large library of classes and tools.

* **Entity Framework Core:** An object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET that simplifies database interactions.  The subtitle mentions `FirstAsync` and `FindAsync`, which are methods provided by EF Core for asynchronous database operations.

* **Select (LINQ):** A LINQ (Language Integrated Query) method used to project elements of a sequence into a new form.  The subtitle mentions `SelectAsync`, an asynchronous version for improved performance.

* **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** A simple object used to transfer data between layers of an application.  It often contains only data fields, without business logic.

* **`async` and `await` in other languages:** The concept of asynchronous programming with `async` and `await`-like constructs is not unique to C#.  Many other languages offer similar features.
