Concepts and Definitions:

*   **API Controller:** A component in an API (Application Programming Interface) that handles incoming requests, processes them, and returns responses. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the API's underlying logic and data.
*   **API Endpoint:** A specific URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that represents a particular operation or resource within an API. It's the address where clients send requests to interact with the API.
*   **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** A specific address that points to a resource on the internet, used to access API endpoints.
*   **List (in API context):** An API endpoint that retrieves a collection of data, often presented as a list or feed.
*   **Detail (in API context):** An API endpoint that retrieves detailed information about a single item or resource, often a specific record from a database.
*   **Model (in software development):** A representation of data and the logic that governs it. In the context of APIs, models often correspond to database tables or data structures.
*   **Controller Base:** A base class that provides common functionality and structure for API controllers, often including features like routing and request handling.
*   **Attributes (in programming):** Metadata that provides additional information about a class, method, or property. In the context of API controllers, attributes are used to define routing, HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), and other aspects of the API's behavior.
*   **Namespace (in programming):** A declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (names of types, methods, etc.) inside it.
*   **Constructor (in object-oriented programming):** A special method within a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It's used to initialize the object's state.
*   **Database Context (DB Context):** An object that represents a session with the database and provides methods for querying and saving data. It's often used in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks.
*   **Read-only (in programming):** A property or variable that can be accessed but not modified after its initialization.
*   **HTTP GET:** An HTTP method used to retrieve data from a server. It's typically used for read-only operations.
*   **Method (in programming):** A block of code that performs a specific task or operation within a class or object.
*   **Database:** An organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
*   **Application DB Context:** A specific implementation of a database context, tailored to the application's data model and database configuration.
*   **Deferred Execution:** A programming technique where the evaluation of an expression is delayed until its result is actually needed. This is common in LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and ORM frameworks.
*   **SQL (Structured Query Language):** A standard language for managing and manipulating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS).
*   **IAction Result:** An interface or abstract class that represents the result of an API action. It provides a way to return different types of responses, such as data, errors, or redirects.
*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Standardized codes that indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. Examples include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).
*   **Model Binding:** The process of automatically converting data from an HTTP request (e.g., URL parameters, form data) into the appropriate data types and objects for use in an API controller.
*   **Parameter (in programming):** A variable declared in the method signature that receives a value when the method is called.
*   **Find (in database context):** A method used to retrieve a specific record from a database table based on its primary key.
*   **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for a record in a database table.
*   **Null Check:** A check to determine if a variable or object has a null value, indicating that it doesn't contain a valid value or reference.
*   **Not Found (HTTP Status):** An HTTP status code (404) that indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server.
*   **Services.AddControllers():** A method used to register API controllers within the application's service container, making them available for handling requests.
*   **app.MapControllers():** A method used to configure the application's routing to map incoming requests to the appropriate API controllers and actions.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume RESTful web services.
*   **SQL Server Management Studio:** A graphical tool for managing SQL Server databases, including creating tables, inserting data, and running queries.
*   **Dummy Data:** Sample or placeholder data used for testing or demonstration purposes.
*   **Net Watch Run:** A command-line tool or feature that automatically recompiles and restarts a .NET application when changes are detected in the source code.
*   **Index Fund:** A type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that aims to replicate the performance of a specific market index.
*   **Market Cap (Market Capitalization):** The total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock, calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding.
*   **HTTPs Redirect Error:** An error that occurs when a web server attempts to redirect a user to a secure (HTTPS) connection, but the redirection fails.
