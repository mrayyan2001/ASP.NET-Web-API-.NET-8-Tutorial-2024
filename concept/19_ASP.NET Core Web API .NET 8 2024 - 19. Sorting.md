Okay, here's a breakdown of the technical concepts and their definitions from the provided subtitle:

**Concepts and Definitions:**

*   **AsQueriable:** An interface or extension method in .NET languages (like C#) that allows LINQ (Language Integrated Query) queries to be translated into SQL queries and executed against a database. It enables deferred execution, where the query is not executed until the results are needed.
*   **Order By Descending:** A clause in SQL or LINQ that sorts the result set in descending order based on the specified column or expression.
*   **Order By:** A clause in SQL or LINQ that sorts the result set in ascending order (by default) based on the specified column or expression.
*   **Two List:** A method in .NET that converts an `IEnumerable` or `IQueryable` sequence into a `List`. Calling `ToList()` forces immediate execution of a deferred query.
*   **SQL:** Structured Query Language, a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
*   **PS Code:** Likely refers to "VS Code", which is Visual Studio Code, a popular source code editor.
*   **Query Object:** A design pattern where query parameters and logic are encapsulated within a dedicated object, promoting code organization and reusability.
*   **Prop:** Short for "property," a member of a class or struct that provides access to an attribute of an object.
*   **String:** A data type representing a sequence of characters.
*   **Sort By:** A parameter or property that specifies the field or attribute to be used for sorting a collection of data.
*   **Ascending/Descending:** Refers to the order of sorting. Ascending means from smallest to largest (A to Z, 1 to 10), while descending means from largest to smallest (Z to A, 10 to 1).
*   **Repository:** A design pattern that provides an abstraction layer between the application and the data access layer, typically used for data persistence and retrieval.
*   **Interface:** A contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement.
*   **If Statement:** A conditional statement in programming that executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
*   **Is Null or White Space:** A method or function that checks if a string is either null, empty, or contains only whitespace characters.
*   **String Comparison:** The process of comparing two strings to determine their equality or relative order.
*   **Ignore Ordinal Case:** A string comparison option that ignores case differences based on the ordinal (numeric) value of characters. It's suitable for basic English and similar character sets.
*   **Unicode:** A standard for encoding characters, assigning a unique numeric value to each character, enabling representation of text in various languages.
*   **Ternary Operator:** A conditional operator (?:) that provides a concise way to express an if-else statement in a single line of code.
*   **Cold Restart:** A complete restart of a system or application, typically involving clearing the cache and reloading all components.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs.
*   **API:** Application Programming Interface, a set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.
*   **Search and Filter:** Functionality that allows users to find specific data within a larger dataset based on defined criteria.
*   **Pagination:** Dividing a large dataset into smaller, discrete pages to improve performance and user experience when displaying data.
