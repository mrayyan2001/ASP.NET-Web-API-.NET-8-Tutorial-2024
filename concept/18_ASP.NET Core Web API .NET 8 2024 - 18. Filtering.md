Okay, here's a breakdown of the technical concepts and their definitions from the provided subtitle:

**Concepts and Definitions:**

*   **List:** A data structure that represents a collection of elements, typically ordered and allowing duplicates.
*   **Database:** An organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
*   **SQL (Structured Query Language):** A standard programming language used for accessing and manipulating databases.
*   **Entity Framework:** An open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET, which enables developers to interact with databases using .NET objects.
*   **AsQueryable:** A method that converts a collection to an `IQueryable` interface, allowing for deferred execution of queries against a data source.
*   **Filtering:** The process of selecting a subset of data that meets specific criteria.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.
*   **VS Code (Visual Studio Code):** A source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
*   **Controller:** In the context of software architecture (like ASP.NET MVC or similar frameworks), a component that handles user input and interacts with the model to prepare data for the view.
*   **Query Parameters:** A way to pass data to a web server through the URL. They are appended to the URL after a question mark (?) and consist of key-value pairs separated by ampersands (&).
*   **Object:** A fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, representing a data structure with associated methods (functions).
*   **Property:** A member of a class or object that provides access to its data.
*   **Interface:** A contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement.
*   **Repository:** A design pattern that provides an abstraction layer between the application and the data access layer, simplifying data access and management.
*   **Async/Await:** Keywords in programming languages (like C#) that enable asynchronous programming, allowing operations to be performed without blocking the main thread.
*   **String:** A sequence of characters, used to represent text.
*   **Whitespace:** Characters that represent empty space, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines.
*   **Contains:** A string method that checks if a specified substring exists within a string.
*   **Where:** A LINQ (Language Integrated Query) operator used to filter a sequence of values based on a predicate (a condition).
*   **To List Async:** An asynchronous method that converts an `IQueryable` or `IEnumerable` sequence to a `List`.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs.
*   **dotnet watch run:** A command-line tool in .NET that automatically restarts the application when changes are detected in the source code.
