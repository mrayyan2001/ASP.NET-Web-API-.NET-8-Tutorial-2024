Concepts and Definitions:

*   **Database:** A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
*   **Pagination:** The process of dividing content into discrete pages, typically in a sequential order, to improve usability and performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
*   **Skip and Take:** Methods used in database queries to implement pagination. "Skip" specifies the number of records to bypass, and "Take" specifies the number of records to retrieve after skipping.
*   **Elements:** A component or constituent of a defined set.
*   **VS Code (Visual Studio Code):** A source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
*   **Query Object:** An object that represents a database query, often used to encapsulate the parameters and logic for retrieving data.
*   **Properties:** A characteristic or attribute of an object.
*   **Page Number:** An integer representing the current page being viewed in a paginated dataset.
*   **Page Size:** The number of items or records displayed on a single page in a paginated dataset.
*   **Repository:** A component or layer in software architecture responsible for abstracting data access and storage operations.
*   **Get All:** A function or method in a repository that retrieves all records from a data source.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other.
*   **Parameters:** A numerical or other measurable factor forming one of a set that defines a system or sets the conditions of its operation.
