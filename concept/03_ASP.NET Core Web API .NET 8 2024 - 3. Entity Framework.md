Concepts and Definitions:

* **Database Tables:**  Structured sets of data organized into rows (records) and columns (fields) within a relational database management system (RDBMS).  They are the fundamental building blocks for storing and managing data.

* **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM):** A programming technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. It bridges the gap between the relational database and the object-oriented programming language.

* **Entity Framework:** A popular ORM framework for .NET applications. It allows developers to interact with databases using .NET objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.

* **Object:** In object-oriented programming, an instance of a class.  In this context, it represents a single row from a database table.

* **NuGet Gallery:** The package manager for the .NET ecosystem. It's used to install and manage libraries and tools needed for .NET projects.

* **SQL Server:** A relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft.

* **.NET (or .NET Framework/.NET Core/.NET 8):** A free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.  The specific version (e.g., .NET 8) indicates a particular release.

* **API.cs:** A file (likely in a .NET project) containing code that defines the application programming interface (API) for a given application.

* **Tools (in NuGet context):**  Refers to additional tools or packages related to Entity Framework and database interaction, installed via NuGet.

* **Design (in NuGet context):**  Likely refers to design-time tools or packages for Entity Framework, aiding in database schema design and management.

* **ApplicationDbContext:** A custom class (in this case) that inherits from `DbContext` in Entity Framework. It acts as a bridge between the application code and the database, defining which database tables the application interacts with.

* **DbContext:** A class in Entity Framework that represents a session with the database. It manages the connection to the database and provides methods for querying and manipulating data.

* **Constructor:** A special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.  It initializes the object's properties.

* **DbContextOptions:**  A class in Entity Framework that holds configuration options for the `DbContext`.

* **Base (in Constructor context):**  Refers to calling the constructor of the base class (`DbContext` in this case) from within a derived class's constructor.  It ensures proper initialization of the inherited class.

* **DBSet:** A property in `DbContext` that represents a table in the database. It provides methods for querying and manipulating data within that table.

* **Deferred Execution:** A feature in Entity Framework where database queries are not executed until the results are actually needed. This improves performance by reducing the number of database calls.

* **Migration:** In Entity Framework, a process that automatically generates and applies changes to the database schema to match the changes in the application's code.

* **Appsettings.json:** A configuration file commonly used in .NET applications to store settings such as database connection strings.

* **Connection String:** A string of characters that contains the information required to connect to a database.

* **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** A graphical tool for managing SQL Server databases.

* **net ef migrations add [Name]:** A command-line command in Entity Framework to generate a migration script.

* **net ef database update:** A command-line command in Entity Framework to apply a migration script to the database.
