Concepts and Definitions:

*   **Endpoint:** A specific URL or address that represents a resource or function within a web service or API.
*   **ID:** A unique identifier, often a number or string, used to distinguish a specific record or entity within a database or system.
*   **Server:** A computer or system that provides resources, data, or services to other computers or devices (clients) over a network.
*   **NT Framework:** Likely refers to .NET Framework or .NET, a software development framework for building applications on Windows and other platforms.
*   **SQL:** Structured Query Language, a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
*   **Database:** An organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
*   **Save Changes:** A function or method used to persist changes made to data within a database, typically by writing the changes to the database's storage.
*   **HTTP Delete:** An HTTP method used to request the deletion of a specified resource from a server.
*   **Annotation:** Metadata added to code, providing additional information about the code elements (e.g., methods, classes) without altering their functionality.
*   **Async/Await:** Keywords in C# (likely the programming language used) that enable asynchronous programming, allowing code to execute without blocking the main thread while waiting for long-running operations (e.g., database queries) to complete.
*   **IAction Result:** An interface in ASP.NET Core (likely the web framework used) that represents the result of an action method in a controller, defining the response to be sent to the client.
*   **From R:** Likely refers to a parameter attribute in ASP.NET Core that specifies how a parameter's value is obtained from the request (e.g., from the route, query string, or body).
*   **Repository:** A design pattern that abstracts the data access logic, providing a consistent interface for interacting with data sources (e.g., databases).
*   **First or Default Async:** A method (likely from LINQ) that retrieves the first element of a sequence, or a default value if no element is found, asynchronously.
*   **Null:** A special value that represents the absence of a value or a non-existent object.
*   **Context:** In this context, likely refers to a database context, which represents a session with the database and provides methods for querying and saving data.
*   **Remove:** A method used to delete an entity from a collection or data store.
*   **Comment Model:** A data model or class representing a comment, likely containing properties such as ID, text, author, etc.
*   **Not Found:** An HTTP status code (404) indicating that the requested resource could not be found on the server.
*   **OK:** An HTTP status code (200) indicating that the request was successful.
*   **VAR:** A keyword in C# used for implicit type declaration, where the compiler infers the data type of a variable based on the assigned value.
*   **Data Validation:** The process of ensuring that data conforms to predefined rules and constraints, such as data type, format, and range.
*   **Security:** Measures taken to protect data and systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
*   **Cold Restart:** A complete restart of an application or system, often involving shutting down and restarting all processes.
*   **Net Watch Run:** A command-line tool or command used in .NET development to automatically rebuild and restart an application when changes are detected in the source code.
*   **HTTP Status Code:** A three-digit code returned by a web server in response to an HTTP request, indicating the status of the request (e.g., success, error).
*   **LINQ:** Language Integrated Query, a feature in .NET that provides a unified way to query data from various sources (e.g., collections, databases) using a consistent syntax.
*   **ASP.NET Core:** A cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications.
*   **C#:** A modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.
