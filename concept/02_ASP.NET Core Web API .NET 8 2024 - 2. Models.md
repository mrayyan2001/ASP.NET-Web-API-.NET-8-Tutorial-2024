Concepts and Definitions:

* **Models:** In the context of database design, a model represents a blueprint or structure for organizing and storing data within a database.  It defines the fields (columns) and their data types for a specific entity or table.

* **One-to-Many Relationship:** A database relationship where one record in a table can be associated with multiple records in another table.  For example, one stock can have many comments.

* **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):**  A set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate and exchange data with each other. In this context, it's code acting as an intermediary between a database and other applications, providing controlled access to the database.

* **Databases:**  A structured set of data organized and accessed electronically from a computer system.  They provide efficient storage and retrieval of information, often organized into tables with rows and columns.

* **Filing Cabinet Analogy:** A metaphor used to explain databases; each drawer represents a table (model), and each file within a drawer represents a record (row) of data.

* **Integer (int):** A whole number (positive, negative, or zero) data type used in programming and databases to represent numerical values without decimal points.

* **ID (Identifier):** A unique numerical or alphanumeric value assigned to each record in a database to distinguish it from other records.

* **String:** A data type representing a sequence of characters (text) in programming and databases.

* **Symbol (Stock Symbol):** A unique abbreviation used to identify a particular stock traded on a stock exchange (e.g., AAPL for Apple).

* **Company Name:** The official name of a publicly traded company.

* **Decimal:** A data type representing numbers with fractional parts (decimal points) in programming and databases.  Used for storing monetary values or other data requiring precision beyond whole numbers.

* **Monetary Amount:** A numerical value representing an amount of money.

* **Dividend:** A payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually out of profits.

* **Industry:** The sector or category of business a company operates in.

* **Market Cap (Market Capitalization):** The total market value of a publicly traded company's outstanding shares.

* **Long (Data Type):** A data type capable of storing larger integer values than a standard integer.

* **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record in a database table.  It ensures that each record is uniquely identifiable and prevents duplicate entries.  In a one-to-many relationship, it's the "parent" side.

* **Foreign Key (FK):** A field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.  It establishes a link between records in different tables, creating a relationship. In a one-to-many relationship, it's on the "child" side.

* **One-to-Many Relationship Modeling:** The process of designing a database schema to represent a one-to-many relationship using primary and foreign keys.

* **List (Data Structure):** A data structure that allows storing an ordered collection of items.  In this context, it's used to represent the many-side of a one-to-many relationship.

* **Entity Framework Core (EF Core):** An object-relational mapper (ORM) framework for .NET that simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with data using objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.

* **Convention-Based Mapping:** A feature of EF Core where it automatically infers relationships between database tables based on naming conventions in the code.

* **Fluent API:** An alternative approach in EF Core to explicitly define database relationships using code, providing more control than convention-based mapping.

* **Navigation Property:** A property in a model class that allows accessing related data in other tables through a database relationship.  It facilitates navigation between related entities.

* **Null Reference Error:** An error that occurs when a program attempts to access a member (property or method) of an object that is currently null (has no value).

* **String.Empty:** A constant representing an empty string in many programming languages.  It's used to initialize string variables to an empty value instead of null.

* **Date Time:** A data type representing a point in time, typically including date and time components.
