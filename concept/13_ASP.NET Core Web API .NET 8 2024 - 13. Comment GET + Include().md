Concepts and Definitions:

*   **Get by ID endpoint:** A specific URL or method within an API that retrieves a resource (e.g., a comment or stock) based on its unique identifier (ID).
*   **Comments:** In this context, textual or other data associated with a stock entity, likely representing user feedback, analysis, or other related information.
*   **Stock entity:** A data structure or object representing a stock, likely containing information such as its name, price, and other relevant details.
*   **One-to-many relationship:** A database relationship where one record in a table (e.g., a stock) can be associated with multiple records in another table (e.g., comments).
*   **Entity Framework:** An object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET applications that simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with data as objects.
*   **Include:** A method in Entity Framework (likely using LINQ) used to eagerly load related data (e.g., comments) along with the primary entity (e.g., stock) in a single database query.
*   **Null:** A special value in programming that represents the absence of a value or a non-existent object.
*   **ICommentRepository:** An interface defining the contract for a repository that handles comment-related data access operations.
*   **Optional:** A return type or data structure that can either contain a value or indicate the absence of a value (e.g., using null or a similar mechanism).
*   **Async:** Denotes an asynchronous operation, meaning the operation can run concurrently without blocking the main thread.
*   **INT:** A data type representing an integer number.
*   **Action Result:** A return type in ASP.NET Core controllers that represents the result of an action method, such as a success (OK) or a failure (Not Found).
*   **OK:** An HTTP status code (200) indicating that the request was successful.
*   **CommentDto:** A Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing the structure of a comment, used to transfer comment data between the application and the client.
*   **Mapper function:** A function or method that transforms data from one format or object type (e.g., a database entity) to another (e.g., a DTO).
*   **VSS code:** Visual Studio Code, a popular source code editor.
*   **Repository:** A design pattern that abstracts data access logic, providing a consistent interface for interacting with data sources.
*   **Not Found:** An HTTP status code (404) indicating that the requested resource was not found.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume RESTful web services.
*   **Tables:** In the context of a database, a structured collection of data organized in rows and columns.
*   **Edit:** A function to modify existing data.
*   **Title:** A descriptive name or heading for a comment.
*   **Content:** The main body or text of a comment.
*   **Created on:** A timestamp indicating when a comment was created.
*   **DTO:** Data Transfer Object, a simple object used to transfer data between layers of an application.
*   **List:** A data structure that represents an ordered collection of items.
*   **Get and Set:** Properties in C# that allow you to read and write the value of a field.
*   **StockDto:** A Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing the structure of a stock, used to transfer stock data between the application and the client.
*   **Stock Model:** A class or data structure representing a stock entity.
*   **Select:** A LINQ method used to project each element of a sequence into a new form.
*   **To List:** A LINQ method used to convert a sequence to a list.
*   **First or Default:** A LINQ method that returns the first element of a sequence, or a default value if no element is found.
*   **Find:** A method in Entity Framework used to retrieve an entity by its primary key.
*   **Newtonsoft:** A popular third-party library for JSON serialization and deserialization in .NET.
*   **MVC:** Model-View-Controller, an architectural pattern for designing user interfaces.
*   **ASP.NET Core:** A cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications.
*   **Program.cs:** The main entry point of a .NET application, typically containing the application's startup code.
*   **Builder:** An object used to configure and build the application's services and settings.
*   **Services:** A collection of components and dependencies that the application uses.
*   **AddControllers:** A method used to add controller services to the application.
*   **AddNewtonsoftJson:** A method used to add Newtonsoft.Json support to the application.
*   **Options:** Configuration settings for a service or component.
*   **Serializer settings:** Configuration settings for the JSON serializer.
*   **Reference Loop Handling:** A setting in the JSON serializer that controls how to handle circular references (where an object refers to itself, directly or indirectly).
*   **Object Cycles:** Circular references between objects, which can cause infinite recursion during serialization.
*   **Net watch run:** A command-line tool that automatically rebuilds and restarts a .NET application when changes are detected.
*   **JSON:** JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format.
*   **API:** Application Programming Interface, a set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.
*   **RESTful:** Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for designing networked applications.
*   **LINQ:** Language Integrated Query, a set of features in .NET that allows you to query data from various sources using a consistent syntax.
