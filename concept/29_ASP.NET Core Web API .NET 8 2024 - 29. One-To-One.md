Concepts and Definitions:

* **One-to-one (1:1) model:** In database modeling, a relationship where one record in a table is associated with only one record in another table.  This is contrasted with one-to-many relationships.

* **One-to-many (1:M) model:** In database modeling, a relationship where one record in a table can be associated with multiple records in another table.  This often uses an array or list to represent the multiple associations.

* **Sub-model:** A smaller, self-contained model that is part of a larger, encompassing model.  It represents a specific aspect or component of the larger model.

* **User-generated content (UGC):** Content created by users of a system or platform, such as comments, reviews, or posts.

* **User model:** A data model representing user information, typically including a unique identifier (e.g., user ID) and other user attributes (e.g., username).

* **Comment model:** A data model representing comments, typically including the comment text and potentially other metadata such as timestamps and user associations.

* **Navigation property:** In object-relational mappers (ORMs) like Entity Framework Core, a property that allows easy access to related data in other tables without writing complex SQL queries.

* **Entity Framework Core (EF Core):** An open-source, object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET that simplifies database interactions.

* **`dotnet ef migrations add`:** A command-line tool within the .NET ecosystem used to generate migrations for Entity Framework Core. Migrations are scripts that update the database schema to match changes in the model.

* **`dotnet ef database update`:** A command-line tool within the .NET ecosystem used to apply pending migrations to the database, updating the database schema.

* **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** A graphical tool for managing and administering Microsoft SQL Server databases.

* **App User ID:** A unique identifier for a user within an application's database.  It's often used as a foreign key to link user data to other tables.

* **Array:** An ordered collection of elements of the same data type.  In the context of database modeling, it's used to represent one-to-many relationships.

* **Object:** In programming, an instance of a class. In this context, it represents a single record in a database table.  The difference between an object and an array is crucial in distinguishing one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.
