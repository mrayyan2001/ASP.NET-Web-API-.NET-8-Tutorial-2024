Okay, here's a breakdown of the technical concepts and their definitions from the provided subtitle:

*   **Log In:** The process of gaining access to a computer system or application by providing credentials such as a username and password.
*   **User Manager:** A component or service responsible for managing user accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting users, as well as retrieving user information.
*   **Signin Manager:** A component or service responsible for handling user authentication and authorization, including verifying credentials and managing user sessions.
*   **HTTP Post:** An HTTP request method used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.
*   **Login DTO (Data Transfer Object):** A simple object used to encapsulate and transfer login-related data (e.g., username and password) between different layers of an application.
*   **C# Class:** A template or blueprint for creating objects in C#, defining the properties (data) and methods (behavior) that the objects will have.
*   **Data Annotations:** Attributes in C# that provide metadata about properties, such as validation rules (e.g., `[Required]`).
*   **Public String Username { Get; Set; }:** A publicly accessible string property named "Username" with both getter and setter methods, allowing its value to be read and modified.
*   **Required:** A data annotation attribute that specifies that a property must have a value; it cannot be null or empty.
*   **Model State:** A collection of values that result from the binding of an HTTP request to a model. It contains both the data and any validation errors associated with that data.
*   **Model State Is Valid:** A check to determine if the data bound to a model meets the validation rules defined by data annotations or other validation mechanisms.
*   **Return Bad Request:** An HTTP response indicating that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., invalid data).
*   **First Or Default:** A LINQ (Language Integrated Query) method that returns the first element of a sequence, or a default value if the sequence contains no elements.
*   **X.Username:** Refers to the "Username" property of an object "X" within a LINQ query.
*   **To Lower Case:** A string method that converts all characters in a string to lowercase.
*   **Return Unauthorized:** An HTTP response indicating that the client is not authorized to access the requested resource, typically due to missing or invalid authentication credentials.
*   **Check Password Async:** An asynchronous method used by the Signin Manager to verify if a provided password matches the stored password for a given user.
*   **Lockout On Failure:** A security feature that temporarily locks a user account after a certain number of failed login attempts.
*   **Result.Succeeded:** A property indicating whether an operation (e.g., sign-in attempt) was successful.
*   **New User DTO:** A new instance of a Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing user information, typically used to return user data to the client.
*   **Token Service:** A component or service responsible for generating and managing security tokens (e.g., JWTs) for authentication and authorization.
*   **CD:** A command-line command used to change the current directory.
*   **API:** Application Programming Interface, a set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.
*   **Net Watch Run:** A .NET CLI command that automatically restarts the application whenever changes to the source code are detected.
*   **Register A New User:** The process of creating a new user account in a system.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs.
*   **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's commonly used for authentication and authorization.
*   **Builder.Services:** A property used to access the service collection in .NET, allowing you to register dependencies and configure services for your application.
*   **Add Swagger Gen:** A method used to add Swagger/OpenAPI generation services to the service collection.
*   **Cold Restart:** Completely stopping and restarting an application, ensuring that all resources are reinitialized.
*   **Authorize:** A security mechanism that restricts access to certain resources or functionalities based on user roles or permissions.
*   **Bearer:** An authentication scheme used in HTTP requests, where a security token (e.g., JWT) is included in the `Authorization` header.
*   **API Endpoint:** A specific URL that represents a resource or functionality exposed by an API.
*   **Params:** Parameters passed to an API endpoint to modify the request.
