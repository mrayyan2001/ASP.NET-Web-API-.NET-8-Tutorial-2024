Concepts and Definitions:

* **Update (in the context of databases):** A database operation that modifies existing data within a record.  Unlike a `CREATE` operation, it requires identifying the specific record to be modified, usually via a unique identifier (ID).

* **Create (in the context of databases):** A database operation that adds a new record to a table.  It does not require an existing record identifier.

* **ID (Identifier):** A unique key used to identify a specific record within a database table.

* **Patch (in the context of databases):** A database operation that modifies only specific fields within an existing record, unlike an `UPDATE` which modifies the entire record.

* **Null:** In databases, represents the absence of a value.  Sending a `NULL` value in an update operation will overwrite the existing value with `NULL`.

* **Object (in the context of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)):** A programming construct representing a database record.  ORMs allow manipulation of database records through object manipulation.

* **Searching Algorithm:** An algorithm used to find a specific record within a database based on certain criteria (e.g., ID, other attributes).  Examples include linear search, binary search, etc.

* **First or Default:** A query method (often found in ORMs) that returns the first matching record or a default value (often `null`) if no match is found.

* **Entity Framework:** An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET that allows developers to interact with databases using objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.

* **Tracking (in the context of ORMs):** The ability of an ORM to monitor changes made to objects representing database records. This allows the ORM to generate the appropriate SQL update statements.

* **Save Changes (in the context of ORMs):** A method (often in ORMs) that persists changes made to tracked objects to the database.

* **SQL (Structured Query Language):** A domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating databases.

* **HTTP POST:** An HTTP request method used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.

* **HTTP PUT:** An HTTP request method used to update a resource on the server.  It requires specifying the resource's identifier (e.g., ID).

* **Annotations (in the context of ASP.NET MVC):** Metadata attributes added to code (e.g., methods) to provide additional information, often used for routing and data binding in web frameworks.

* **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** A simple object used to transfer data between layers of an application.  Often used to encapsulate data for API requests and responses.

* **Endpoint (in the context of APIs):** A specific URL or address that an API client can use to interact with a server.

* **Repository (in the context of software design):** A design pattern that abstracts away data access logic, providing a cleaner interface for interacting with data sources.

* **Null Check:** A programming construct that verifies if a variable or object holds a `NULL` value before attempting to use it to prevent errors.


* **From Route (ASP.NET MVC):**  Attribute used to bind data from the URL route to a method parameter.

* **From Body (ASP.NET MVC):** Attribute used to bind data from the request body (e.g., JSON) to a method parameter.

* **Mapper:** A component that transforms data from one format to another (e.g., converting a database object to a DTO).
