Concepts and Definitions:

* **Many-to-many relationship:** A database relationship where multiple records in one table can be linked to multiple records in another table.  This requires a join table (or intermediary table).

* **Join table:** An intermediary table used to implement many-to-many relationships in a relational database. It contains foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the tables it connects.

* **Pseudocode:** An informal high-level description of the operating principle of an algorithm or a program. It uses natural language mixed with programming-like constructs but is not executable code.

* **User ID:** A unique identifier assigned to a user in a database system.

* **Stock ID (or Stock Symbol):** A unique identifier (often a ticker symbol) assigned to a stock in a database system.

* **Object (in programming):** An instance of a class, containing data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.

* **Portfolio (in this context):** A database object representing a user's holdings of stocks.  It acts as the join table in the many-to-many relationship between users and stocks.

* **Database:** A structured set of data organized and accessed electronically from a computer system.

* **Endpoint (in API):** A specific address or URL that an application uses to communicate with a web service or API.

* **POST (HTTP method):** An HTTP request method used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.

* **Authorize (in API security):** The process of verifying the identity and permissions of a user or client attempting to access a resource.

* **Claims (in JWT):**  Statements about a user or client, typically included in a JSON Web Token (JWT), used for authentication and authorization.

* **Token (in authentication):** A string of characters used to authenticate a user or client.  Often a JWT (JSON Web Token).

* **Async (asynchronous):**  A programming paradigm where operations can run concurrently without blocking the main thread, improving responsiveness.

* **Task (in C#):** A class representing an asynchronous operation.

* **IActionResult (in ASP.NET Core):**  A base class for action results in ASP.NET Core controllers, representing the result of an action method.

* **Repository (in software design):** A design pattern that abstracts data access logic, separating it from the business logic of an application.

* **Interface (in programming):** A contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement.

* **Repository method:** A function within a repository class that performs a specific data access operation (e.g., get, create, update, delete).

* **First or Default (LINQ):** A LINQ method that returns the first element of a sequence that satisfies a condition, or a default value if no such element is found.

* **Validation check:** A process to ensure that data meets certain criteria before it is processed or stored.

* **Duplicate (in data):** A record that is identical to another record in a dataset.

* **Code smell:** A characteristic in source code that possibly indicates a deeper problem.

* **Controller (in MVC):** In a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, the controller handles user input, updates the model, and selects a view to display.

* **Swagger:** An open-source software framework for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful web services.

* **.NET:** A free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

* **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between parties as a JSON object.  Often used for authentication.
