Concepts and Definitions:

*   **Comment Update:** The process of modifying the content or attributes of an existing comment within a system.
*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
*   **ID (Identifier):** A unique value used to identify a specific record or entity within a database or system.
*   **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** An object that carries data between processes, often used to encapsulate data for transfer over a network or between layers of an application.
*   **Controller:** A component in an application (often in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern) that handles incoming requests, processes them, and returns responses.
*   **PUT (HTTP Method):** An HTTP method used to request that the server replace the entire target resource with the request payload.
*   **Route:** A specific URL endpoint in a web application that is associated with a particular function or action.
*   **Action Result:** A return type in ASP.NET Core controllers that represents the result of an action method, such as a view, a JSON response, or a redirect.
*   **From Route:** An attribute in ASP.NET Core that binds a parameter in a controller action to a value in the route.
*   **From Body:** An attribute in ASP.NET Core that binds a parameter in a controller action to the body of an HTTP request.
*   **Repository:** A design pattern that abstracts the data access logic, providing a consistent interface for interacting with data sources (e.g., databases).
*   **Async/Await:** Keywords in C# used to write asynchronous code, allowing operations to run without blocking the main thread.
*   **Nullable:** A feature in C# that allows value types to be assigned a null value, indicating the absence of a value.
*   **Entity Framework:** An object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET applications that simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with data as objects.
*   **FindAsync:** An asynchronous method in Entity Framework used to retrieve an entity from the database by its primary key.
*   **Comment Model:** A class or data structure that represents the structure and attributes of a comment in the application's data model.
*   **Tracking:** A feature in Entity Framework that monitors changes made to entities retrieved from the database.
*   **Save Changes Async:** An asynchronous method in Entity Framework that persists changes made to tracked entities to the database.
*   **Mapper:** A component or function that transforms data from one format or structure to another, often used to convert between DTOs and domain models.
*   **Not Found (HTTP Status Code):** An HTTP status code (404) indicating that the requested resource could not be found on the server.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services.
*   **Netwatch run:** A command-line tool or process used to automatically rebuild and restart a .NET application when changes are detected in the source code.
