Concepts and Definitions:

* **Software:** A set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.
* **Data Creation:** The process of generating new data, often within a specific application or system.
* **Web Development:** The process of building and maintaining websites and web applications.
* **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** A set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate and exchange data with each other.
* **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.  It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
* **POST (HTTP Verb):** An HTTP request method used to submit data to be processed (e.g., creating or updating a resource) to the server.
* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight data-interchange format that uses a key-value pair structure for representing data.
* **Server:** A computer system that provides data to or shares resources with clients (e.g., web browsers).
* **Database:** A structured set of data organized and accessed electronically from a computer system.
* **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** A software design pattern that separates the application's concerns into three interconnected parts: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (application logic).
* **Entity Framework:** An object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables .NET developers to work with databases using .NET objects.
* **Add Method (Entity Framework):** A method within Entity Framework that adds an entity to the context's change tracker, preparing it for persistence to the database.  It does not immediately save to the database.
* **Change Tracking (Entity Framework):** The process by which Entity Framework monitors changes made to entities within its context.
* **SaveChanges Method (Entity Framework):** A method in Entity Framework that persists all tracked changes to the database.
* **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** An object used to transfer data between layers of an application.  It often contains a subset of the data in a larger model.
* **Controller Endpoint:** In a web application, a specific URL that handles requests from clients.
* **HTTP Body:** The part of an HTTP request that contains the data being sent to the server.
* **Mapper:** A component that transforms data from one format to another (e.g., from a DTO to a database model).
* **Model:** In the context of MVC and Entity Framework, a representation of data in the application.
* **`from body` attribute:** An attribute used in web frameworks (like ASP.NET Core) to indicate that the data for a request parameter should be read from the HTTP request body.
* **`IActionResult`:** An interface in ASP.NET Core that represents the result of an action method in a controller.
* **`public static` method:** A method in C# that is accessible from anywhere and doesn't require an object instance to be called.
* **`get by ID`:** A method (likely custom) to retrieve data from a database based on an ID.
* **`created at` function:** A function (likely custom) that handles the creation timestamp of a record.
