Okay, here's a breakdown of the technical concepts and their definitions from the provided subtitle:

**Concepts and Definitions:**

*   **Hashing:** A one-way cryptographic function that transforms data of any size into a fixed-size string of text (the hash). It's designed to be computationally infeasible to reverse, making it suitable for password storage.
*   **Salting:** Adding a unique, random string to each password before hashing. This mitigates the risk of rainbow table attacks, where precomputed hashes are used to crack passwords.
*   **Database:** A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
*   **VS Code:** Visual Studio Code, a source code editor developed by Microsoft.
*   **Controller:** In the context of software architecture (specifically MVC or similar patterns), a controller is a component that handles user input and interacts with the model to update the view.
*   **API:** Application Programming Interface. A set of defined rules that enable different software applications to communicate with each other.
*   **Route:** A URL pattern that maps to a specific controller action in a web application.
*   **API Controller:** A controller specifically designed to handle API requests, typically returning data in formats like JSON or XML.
*   **User Manager:** In ASP.NET Core Identity, a service that provides APIs for managing users, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving users.
*   **Private Property:** A class member that is only accessible from within the class in which it is declared.
*   **Readonly:** A keyword that prevents modification of a field after it has been initialized.
*   **Constructor:** A special method that is called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's state.
*   **Endpoint:** A specific URL that an API exposes, representing a specific function or resource.
*   **Post:** An HTTP method used to submit data to a server to create or update a resource.
*   **JSON:** JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
*   **DTO:** Data Transfer Object. A simple object used to encapsulate data and transfer it between layers of an application.
*   **Validation:** The process of ensuring that data meets specific criteria or constraints before it is processed or stored.
*   **.NET Core:** A free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. It is a cross-platform successor to .NET Framework.
*   **Annotation:** A form of metadata that provides supplemental information about a program.
*   **Regex:** Regular Expression, a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
*   **Identity:** An ASP.NET Core framework for managing user authentication and authorization.
*   **Roles:** In the context of user management, roles define a set of permissions or privileges that are assigned to users.
*   **Model Creating:** A method in Entity Framework Core that is called when the model is being created. It allows you to configure the model using a fluent API.
*   **Builder:** An object that is used to construct other objects.
*   **Identity Role:** A class in ASP.NET Core Identity that represents a role.
*   **Normalized Name:** A standardized, uppercase version of a role name used for efficient comparison.
*   **Has Data:** A method in Entity Framework Core that is used to seed data into a table.
*   **Tri Catch:** A programming construct used for exception handling. The `try` block contains code that might throw an exception, and the `catch` block contains code that handles the exception.
*   **Server Errors:** Errors that occur on the server side of a web application.
*   **Model State Validation:** A process in ASP.NET Core that validates the data in a model against validation attributes.
*   **App User:** A custom class that inherits from the ASP.NET Core Identity User class.
*   **Create Async:** An asynchronous method in the User Manager that creates a new user.
*   **Add to Role Async:** An asynchronous method in the User Manager that adds a user to a role.
*   **Status Code:** A three-digit code that indicates the status of an HTTP request.
*   **Migration:** A set of code changes that update the database schema.
*   **Net EF Migrations:** A .NET command-line tool for managing Entity Framework Core migrations.
*   **Net Watch Run:** A .NET command-line tool that automatically restarts the application when changes are detected.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs.
*   **ASP.NET User:** A table in the database that stores user information.
*   **Tokens:** A security token is a digital representation of an identity and a set of privileges.
