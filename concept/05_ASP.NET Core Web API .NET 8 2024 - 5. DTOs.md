Concepts and Definitions:

*   **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** A design pattern used to transfer data between software application layers, often used to reduce the amount of data transferred or to reshape the data for specific needs, such as API responses or requests.
*   **.NET Core:** A cross-platform, open-source, and free managed framework for building web apps, services, desktop apps, and more.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.
*   **Response DTO:** A DTO specifically designed to format the data returned by an API to a client.
*   **Request DTO:** A DTO specifically designed to format the data sent by a client to an API.
*   **Model:** A representation of data within an application, often corresponding to a database table or a business entity.
*   **Data Annotations:** Attributes used in .NET to add metadata to model properties, often used for data validation, formatting, and other data-related behaviors.
*   **Automapper:** A .NET library that provides a convention-based object-to-object mapping solution, simplifying the process of mapping between different object types.
*   **Extension Methods:** Static methods that can be called as if they were instance methods on a type, allowing for the extension of existing types without modifying their original definition.
*   **Static:** In the context of programming, a keyword that indicates a member (e.g., a method or variable) belongs to the class itself rather than to an instance of the class.
*   **Stock DTO:** A DTO specifically designed to represent stock data, often used to control which stock-related information is exposed through an API.
*   **Stock Model:** A class or data structure that represents the properties of a stock, such as its ID, symbol, company name, and other relevant information.
*   **LINQ (Language Integrated Query):** A set of features in .NET that allows for querying data from various sources (e.g., collections, databases) using a consistent syntax.
*   **Select (LINQ):** A LINQ operator that projects each element of a sequence into a new form, effectively transforming the data. It is similar to the `map` function in JavaScript.
*   **Immutable:** Data that cannot be changed after it is created.
*   **Controller:** In the context of web development (e.g., ASP.NET Core), a class that handles incoming HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses.
*   **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
