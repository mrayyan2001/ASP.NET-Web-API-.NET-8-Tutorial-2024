Concepts and Definitions:

*   **HTTP Verbs:** Methods used in HTTP requests to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. Examples include GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.
*   **Entity Framework:** An object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET applications that allows developers to work with a database using .NET objects. It simplifies database interactions by abstracting away the underlying SQL queries.
*   **ID (Identifier):** A unique value used to identify a specific record or entity within a database or system.
*   **SQL (Structured Query Language):** A standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
*   **Database:** An organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
*   **HTTP Delete:** An HTTP method used to request the deletion of a specified resource.
*   **Route:** In web development, a route defines how an application responds to a specific client request to a particular endpoint.
*   **Action Result:** A return type in ASP.NET Core MVC that represents the result of an action method, such as a view, a redirect, or a status code.
*   **From Route:** A binding source in ASP.NET Core that indicates that a parameter should be bound from the route data.
*   **DB Context (Database Context):** In Entity Framework, a class that represents a session with the database and provides methods for querying and saving data.
*   **First or Default:** A LINQ method that attempts to retrieve the first element of a sequence, or a default value if the sequence is empty.
*   **Null Check:** A check to determine if a variable or object has a null value, which indicates that it does not refer to any object or data.
*   **Model:** A representation of data within an application, often corresponding to a table in a database.
*   **Remove (Function):** A method in Entity Framework used to mark an entity for deletion from the database.
*   **Save Changes:** A method in Entity Framework that persists changes made to entities in the database.
*   **No Content (HTTP Status Code):** An HTTP status code (204) that indicates that the request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response body.
*   **Swagger:** A set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services.
*   **RESTful Web Services:** Web services that adhere to the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style, using HTTP methods to interact with resources.
*   **Endpoint:** A specific URL or URI that represents a resource or a function within an API.
*   **LINQ (Language Integrated Query):** A set of features in .NET that allows developers to query data from various sources, including databases, in a consistent manner.
*   **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** An architectural pattern for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts: the model, the view, and the controller.
*   **ASP.NET Core:** A cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications.
