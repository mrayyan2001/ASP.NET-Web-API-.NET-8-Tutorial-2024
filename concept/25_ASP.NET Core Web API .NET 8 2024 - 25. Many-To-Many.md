Okay, here's a breakdown of the technical concepts and their definitions from the provided subtitle:

**Concepts and Definitions:**

*   **Many-to-Many Relationship:** A database relationship where multiple records in one table can be related to multiple records in another table.
*   **Stock Portfolio:** A collection of stocks owned by an individual or entity.
*   **One-to-Many Relationship:** A database relationship where one record in a table can be related to multiple records in another table, but each record in the second table can only be related to one record in the first table.
*   **Join Table:** A database table that is used to establish and manage many-to-many relationships between two other tables. It typically contains foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the related tables.
*   **User ID:** A unique identifier for a user in a database system.
*   **Stock ID:** A unique identifier for a stock in a database system.
*   **EF Core (Entity Framework Core):** A modern, lightweight, open-source, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework. It is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET.
*   **Convention (in EF Core):** A set of default rules and configurations that EF Core uses to automatically map classes to database tables and relationships, reducing the amount of explicit configuration required.
*   **IDs (Identifiers):** A value that uniquely identifies an object or record within a system or database.
*   **Navigation Properties:** Properties in an entity class that represent relationships to other entities. They allow you to navigate and access related data.
*   **On Model Creating:** A method in Entity Framework Core that allows you to configure the database model using the fluent API. It's used to define relationships, constraints, and other database schema details.
*   **Application DB Context:** A class in Entity Framework Core that represents a session with the database and allows you to query and save data. It derives from `DbContext`.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.
*   **Models Folder:** A directory in a software project that contains the data models or entity classes that represent the structure of the data.
*   **Foreign Keys:** A column or set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between the two tables.
*   **App User ID:** A foreign key that references the primary key of the "App User" table.
*   **List (in C#):** A generic collection type in C# that represents an ordered collection of objects that can be accessed by index.
*   **Null Reference Errors:** An error that occurs when a program attempts to use an object reference that has a null (empty) value.
*   **Table Names:** The names assigned to tables within a database schema.
*   **DB Set (Database Set):** A property on a `DbContext` that represents a collection of entities of a specific type. It allows you to query and save instances of that entity type to the database.
*   **Entity (in EF Core):** Represents an object or concept in the application domain that can be persisted to a database.
*   **Has Key:** An EF Core method used to configure the primary key of an entity.
*   **Has One:** An EF Core method used to configure a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.
*   **With Many:** An EF Core method used to configure the "many" side of a one-to-many relationship.
*   **Has Foreign Key:** An EF Core method used to specify the foreign key property in a relationship.
*   **Migrations:** A feature of Entity Framework Core that allows you to evolve the database schema over time by applying incremental changes.
*   **Database:** An organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
*   **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** A software application used to manage SQL Server databases.
*   **Net EF Migrations Add:** A command-line instruction used in .NET development with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to create a new migration.
*   **Net EF Database Update:** A command-line instruction used in .NET development with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to apply pending migrations to a database.
