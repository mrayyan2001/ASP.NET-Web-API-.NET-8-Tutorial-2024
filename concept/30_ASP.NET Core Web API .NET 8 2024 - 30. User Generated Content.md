Concepts and Definitions:

* **One-to-one relationship (in databases):** A database relationship where one record in a table is associated with only one record in another table.  In this context, it links a user to their comments.

* **Troll comments:**  Comments posted online with the intention of provoking an emotional response or disrupting a discussion, often using inflammatory or irrelevant content.

* **Comment infrastructure:** The underlying systems and processes supporting the creation, storage, and retrieval of comments on a platform.

* **Comment model:** A data structure (often a database table or object) representing the attributes of a comment (e.g., text, timestamp, user ID).

* **App User:**  A data model representing a registered user within an application.

* **Create comment process:** The sequence of steps involved in submitting and saving a new comment.

* **Comment controller (in MVC):**  In a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, this is the component responsible for handling requests related to comments, including creation.

* **User Manager:** A class or component responsible for managing user accounts and data.

* **Claims extension:** A mechanism (likely within an authentication system) to access user information associated with a security token.

* **Find by name/username:** A database query method to retrieve a user record based on their username.

* **Comment DTO (Data Transfer Object):** A data structure used to transfer comment data between layers of an application.

* **App User ID:** A unique identifier for a user within the application's database.

* **Deferred execution (in LINQ):** A feature where database queries are not executed until the results are actually needed, allowing for efficient query composition.

* **Includes (in LINQ/ORM):**  A query clause used to eagerly load related data from the database, avoiding multiple database trips.

* **First or default (in LINQ):** A method that returns the first element of a sequence that satisfies a condition, or a default value if no such element exists.

* **Nested objects (in databases):** Objects within objects; in this case, comments nested within stocks, and users nested within comments.

* **ThenInclude (in LINQ):**  An extension to the `Include` method, allowing for the loading of multiple levels of related data.

* **Link query:** A query that retrieves data from multiple related tables in a database.

* **Stock controller:**  In an MVC architecture, this component handles requests related to stock data.

* **Stock DTO:** A data structure used to transfer stock data between application layers.

* **Two List():** A method (likely an extension method) to convert a query result into a list.

* **Swagger:** An open-source software framework for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful web services.
