Concepts and Definitions:

*   **Refactoring:** The process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior.
*   **Repository Pattern:** A design pattern that abstracts data access logic, providing a clean separation between the data access layer and the business logic. It typically involves a repository class that encapsulates the logic for retrieving and persisting data.
*   **Database Code:** Code that interacts with a database, including operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations).
*   **Interface:** A contract that defines a set of methods, properties, and events that a class or struct must implement. It specifies "what" a class should do, not "how" it should do it.
*   **Asynchronous (async):** A programming technique that allows a program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a long-running operation (like a database call) to complete.
*   **Get By ID Async:** An asynchronous method that retrieves a specific data item from a data source (e.g., a database) based on its unique identifier (ID).
*   **First or Default:** A method that attempts to retrieve the first element of a sequence, or a default value if the sequence is empty or no element satisfies a condition. In the context of database queries, it often returns `null` if no matching record is found.
*   **Null:** A special value that represents the absence of a value.
*   **Create Async:** An asynchronous method that adds a new data item to a data source.
*   **Stock:** In this context, likely refers to a data entity representing a stock or share in a company.
*   **Stock Entity/Model:** A class or data structure that represents a stock, containing properties like ID, name, price, etc.
*   **Update Async:** An asynchronous method that modifies an existing data item in a data source.
*   **Delete Async:** An asynchronous method that removes a data item from a data source.
*   **INT:** A data type representing an integer number.
*   **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** An object that carries data between processes. In this context, it's used to transfer data related to a stock update.
*   **Implementing an Interface:** The process of creating a class that provides concrete implementations for all the members (methods, properties, etc.) defined in an interface.
*   **Context:** In the context of database interactions (e.g., Entity Framework), a context object represents a session with the database and provides methods for querying and saving data.
*   **Save Changes Async:** An asynchronous method that persists changes made to the data context (e.g., adding, updating, or deleting data) to the underlying data store (e.g., a database).
*   **Fetch:** To retrieve data from a data source.
*   **Existing Stock Model:** A variable that holds the data of a stock that already exists in the database.
*   **Find Async:** An asynchronous method that searches for an entity in the database based on its primary key.
*   **Controller:** In the context of web development (e.g., ASP.NET Core), a component that handles incoming requests, processes them, and returns responses.
*   **Get All Async:** An asynchronous method that retrieves all data items from a data source.
*   **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, which are the fundamental operations performed on data in a database.
*   **Stock Repo:** Short for "Stock Repository," a class that encapsulates the data access logic for stock-related operations.
*   **Web Server:** A computer that delivers web pages to clients.
*   **204 (No Content):** An HTTP status code indicating that the request was successfully processed, but there is no content to send in the response body.
*   **Dummy Values:** Placeholder data used for testing or demonstration purposes.
