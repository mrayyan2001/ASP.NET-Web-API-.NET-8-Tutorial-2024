so delete is going to be another easy endpoint to make all that is going to require is that you pass up the ID send it to the server then you just check if it exists as always then you use the remove function that is provided to you by NT framework it is going to be tracked and if you actually want the SQL to be sent to the database you run save changes and that's pretty much it and after you run all that the delete occurs and it no longer actually exists within the database but that was very easy let's go ahead let's go inside of uh vs code here and first thing that I'm going to start with and you can start wherever you want to but I'm going to go ahead start inside the controller uh we need to go here below the actual put and we're going to do HTTP delete and would you look at that there's already a nice little annotation provided for you next thing you want to do is go into here and because we need the ID remember that we're going to have to have the ID uh of the actual record we're going to go ahead pass in that string so Public async public async then we're going to go here task I action result and then we will uh name it delete you can name it whatever you want to but it's probably best to name and delete and we're going to go ahead have the from R you don't have to have that but it's good to be as explicit as you can so next thing I'm going to do is go inside of my comment repository I am sweating it is really hot inside of my house for some reason but I'm just going to go ahead TP it through so if you notice me sweating I I know that I'm sweating and I am trying to finish this tutorial as quickly as I can so I can turn on the air conditioner and I don't know it's almost Christmas Day and I have no idea why it's so hot and it's so hot in North Carolina Okay so we've got our actual signature inside of our interface what we're going to do now is go inside of our repository and we're going to go ahead implement this interface we now have this method right here we're going to go ahead do what we always do we're going to check to make sure it exists you need to check to make sure that the record actually exists because you can't delete a record that doesn't exist and we need to return null anyway too so we're going to go comments we're going to go first or default async I'm going to go x uh x. ID is equal to pass in the ID goes without saying and then we're going to of course check to make sure that it is not null and if it is null we're going to return we're going to go here if it is null we're going to return looking good then after that what we're going to do is we're going to have our context we're going to take our comments and we are going to remove here and we're going to go ahead pass in our comment model next thing we're going to await and also remember that the remove does not have an await that is very key point because if you try to use an await with the remove you're not going to find any method so save changes async then after that we are going to return the comment model very simple very similar to the uh actual endpoint that we created earlier so first thing we're going to do is we're going to go here we're going to go VAR comment model it's going to be very similar to the actual repository that we made in terms of the wording then here I'm going to go await we'll go comment repo and we are going to delete async and we're going to go ahead pass in the ID and yes the ID is the only thing that is needed then here if comment model is equal to null so if we do get null back so if there is nothing there we are going to return not found so return not found you say comment does not exist looking good then if it does exist what we're going to do is we are going to return okay and then we're going to return the comment model although you don't have to you don't have to actually put this in there you could just return blank if you want to okay and I'm not getting any errors so I think we are good pretty much good to go do you want to restart your app yes and I'm just going to go ahead do a cold restart so I'm going to go net watch run then we're going to go let's go get all of our comments so get all the comments I love paler let's just say I don't love paler anymore and we want to get rid of number two so what I'm going to do here is go ahead toss in a number two and looks like we got everything back that we wanted let's check to make sure it was deleted and we no longer have number two which is the is of paler anyways after this we're going to start working on data validation and then we're on to security that you guys enjoyed this if you did make sure to smash that like button make sure to smash that subscribe Button as always thank you for watching
