So currently we have maybe 10 records in our database but what if we had 10,000 records what if you try to return 10,000 records at once your app would probably crash that's why we have pagination pagination is going to do two things number one it's going to make sure we don't return everything at once and it's going to break everything into Pages kind of what the way that pagination sounds you are turning things into pages but where it gets confusing is that we have this thing called Skip and take and a quick glance at Skip and take and you're probably thinking what does Skip and take me why do I have to learn these things but skip is just the way that s sounds you going to skip the first two elements and you're going to take the rest of the elements but you may be thinking well how does that create passation this is crazy well take is going to do the exact opposite take is not going to skip it's going to take and when you combine Skip and take together you get magic so you skip the first two and then you take the next just like this and you can plug in numbers and turn it into pagination isn't that amazing so let's go ahead let's hop inside vs code and let's actually implement it so first things first we're going right back to the query object just like before you could totally put the page donation parameters directly in right here but I'm not going to do that because we are at like eight properties now and we can't add anymore so first thing I'm going to do I'm going to go prop I'm going to set this to page number we're going to make this one so by default uh if we don't put anything in there it's just going to give us the first page and we could you could set this number you could set the next number or the page size very low so we'll have int we'll have page size but I'm think think in 20 and that should be enough and if you need 20 more uh you could easily add the page number but um 20 is going to be perfect we're not going to be showing more than 20 stocks on a page anyway and if you really need it go ahead add a number two or add more to the page number okay so last thing this is going to be very simple we're going to go inside of our repository and we're going to go back down to our get all and right below here what we're going to do is we're going to add what's called a skip number um and this is very common this is how you do the calculation for the pagination we'll go query um page number we're going to go ahead add a minus one because we don't want to add because if we don't add that it's going to be always one ahead of it and then we're going to go query. page size and we're going to go down here and instead instead of return await we're going to go ahead just tack this on so we'll go stocks skip we're going so this is where we're going to use our Skip and our take we're going to put our skip number in here then we're going to do our take and this is where we're going to put our page size so take whatever so whenever we do pagination we're going to uh have a page size of I think what do we have like 20 so that's pretty much it let's go ahead Let's test it out go ahead open Swagger let's go down to our stock got our symbol we've got our sort by and let's just test out the patient number so obviously let's just leave page number blank and then let's set a page size of five so Z one two three 4 and I'll set it maybe we need to set it just a little bit lower so let's set it to three so we got one two three let's let's do four one two three four and let's also check how many that we actually have so let's go ahead do the page size we'll do page number we'll just leave both of them blank and make sure that we're getting everything so one two three four okay so we are getting everything that's pretty much it hope that you guys enjoyed this if you did make sure to smash that like button make sure to smash that subscribe button and as always thank you for watching
