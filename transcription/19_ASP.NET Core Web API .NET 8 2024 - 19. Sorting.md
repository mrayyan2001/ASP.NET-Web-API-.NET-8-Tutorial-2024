okay guys so this video we're using as queriable once again and we need as queriable because we need to sort with order by descending and Order bu and remember we can't use two list too early we have to use two list after we get done doing our sorting so that it builds the SQL sends it to the database and we actually get this back in the form of a variable so let's go ahead let's hop inside PS code very quickly and I'm going to put everything inside of the query object you could easily put this inside of the actual parameter and bust it up into individual parameters but I'm putting everything inside the query object because I think it looks a little bit better so first things first we're going to do a prop and we're going to go uh string and we're going to call this sort by because we need to be specific what we want to sort by it really wouldn't make sense to just say sort every individual uh column if that makes sense we're going to give it a null because a lot of times we don't want to sort um then we're going to give it an ascending or a descending uh don't make this optional and we're going to say is descending just like that and let's go ahead just for a good measure set it to false as default Al although it's going to be false either ways but let's just be a little official next thing that we want to do is we want to go inside of our actual repository we're not going to really mess with our interface and what this boils down to is just creating another if statement so that when it actually passes in it will trigger okay then we're going to uh have is or null or is null or whites space go ahead pass in the query and we will say query sort by so if there is a actual sort by value it will trigger it looking good and we're going to go down go ahead throw some brackets in there and then we're going to have another if statement and this is what what's going to actually trigger the column so we'll go query uh if sort by is equal to and you could put whatever you want to but I am going to say equals and we'll say symbol I am going to sort by the symbol for each individual column that you want to sort by all that you do is you put another uh you put another if statement in here to actually trigger it and I'm going to say string comparison and I'm going to say uh ignore the ordinal case and what this boils down to this ordinal case thing is if you have ex I would say exotic forms of Unicode so Unicode that has a till day Unicode that has some type of foreign symbol in it if you have those things you're going to have to change this to something else but in the case of most people if you're just using regular English language or even just regular foreign language that uses uh English unic code or regular letters you can get away with it so that's what that is so we're going to go is descending and this is what's actually going to trigger the ascending or descending and if it is true if we do want Ascend or descending what we're going to have is uh order by descending so we'll say order by descending and in our case or in my case I decided to sort based off of the symbol so I'm going to pass in the symbol then we will have the colon and the colon is a ternary operator that's going to trigger if false so if it's false what we're going to have is just regular order bu and the order bu you just go ahead put in the same thing that you put for the other one so we're going to say symbol okay looking good and that is pretty much it so let's go ahead and let's test this thing so go into here and I'm going to do a cold restart just to make sure everything's working and Swagger will pick it up and it'll be really easy I'll show you guys what to do so we are inside of swagger right now and I am going to go to the stock and now we have we can now search and filter by the symbol we can do the sort by and we can do asending or descending and I'm going to search by symbol and let's say we're going to set descending true so go ahead go ahead and run it and what you look at that it is now descending if we want to do ascending so we'll go ascending but asending to false and now we have Amazon J&J Microsoft Tesla so that is sorting next video we're going to do pattion hope that you guys enjoyed this if you did make sure to smash that like button smash that subscribe button and as always thank you for watching
