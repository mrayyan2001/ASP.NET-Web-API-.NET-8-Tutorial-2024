so our last and our final model is going to be the one: one and the one: one is great for what I call sub models it's great for putting models within your model that's a lot of models but in our case we're going to make something called user generated content and whenever a user makes a comment a lot of times it's very fun to see who created that comment and that's what we're going to do we're going to add a user model to our comment so that we can see the username and the user is pretty much a submodel of our comment model but what is the actual difference between a one to manyi and a one: one well a one to many if you notice here has an array this array is very important because it gives us the ability to add more than one object this would be a representation of our comment model if it was a one to many but we're not going to do that the true difference between a one to one and a one to many is that the model is only going to have object brackets and that is a very very different thing than arrays so our one to many is going to look like this and this is the reason that a one to many is a one to many there can be no other data added to it because there's no array here it's just just an object how do we actually create a on to many in Entity framework core though it's actually the easiest of the easy all that you do is you add your user ID you use you add the navigation property and you don't add the list like you do with a one to many there's no list on the other side it's literally just the user ID and the navigation property and that's it so that's it let's go ahead let's hop inside vs code and let's code it up so let's go into our models folder and we are going to pull up the comment model and all that I'm going to do is I'm just going to go down here I'm going to say public string we're going to match this with our app user ID we're going to say Get Set I going to say public app user it's equal to app user and say Get Set and that's pretty much it so let's go let's CD into our API make sure that you're within the API I'm going to go netf migrations add I'm going to call this comment one two one and it succeeded it hung there for a little bit I was like getting scared okay then we're going to go net EF database update so let's go ahead run this and while we're doing that I'm going to go ahead and start up SQL Server management studio so I'm going to go ahead and run it just to make sure that it is compiling looks good so let's go inside of SQL Server here let's go up to our database let's go to fin shark and let's make sure that it created the app user within our comments so I'm going to select the top 1,00 rows and if you look we now have the app user ID for the last column so that's pretty much it let's go ahead we'll move on to the next video where we're going to tackle user generated comments hope that you guys enjoyed this if you did Smash that like button smash that subscribe Button as always thank you for watching
