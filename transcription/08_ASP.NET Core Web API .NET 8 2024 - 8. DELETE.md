so out of all of the HTTP verbs delete is going to be the easiest by far and all that it entails is sending an ID to the API where the record will be deleted and Entity framework does most of this for you the only thing that you have to do is use the ID to find the first stock or entity whichever you're using and then passing this entity into the remove function of Entity Framework calling save changes it's going to send the SQL to the database you are pretty much good to go so let's go ahead let's hop inside a vs code and let's get coding so this one's going to be short Suite into the point just the way we like it so let's go into here and we are going to have a delete HTTP delete and then we're going to go down here we're going to have a route remember we need to have this route and we need to pass in an ID because we need to actually be able to see number one we can't delete anything if it doesn't exist so we're going to check if it exists first but let's go ahead let's make our signature so I action result we'll have our delete and the delete is going to have a from Route um we might we'll just put it there for good good measure make sure just to have it from Route it's better to be official than to be sorry and just leave it out and it something messes up so just even though we could just leave that out I wouldn't recommend it let's say let's go context we'll go stocks first or default and X is equal to x. ID is equal to the ID that we are passing in from here so remember we're going to go check to see this is a this is a very important part of many apis is doing the first or default check and making sure that it exists because there's certain endpoints just try to form the correlation of which endpoints need to be checked if something if they actually exist or if the model actually exists and which don't and it will help you a ton so we've already checked if we've already done a null check now we're going to go down here we're going to do contexts go into our stock application DB context we're going to go remove we're going to pass in our stock model of course we're going to go context save changes then here we're going to return no content and no content is kind of a strange one might not have seen that any before but whenever you do a delete no content is a success so it's a status 200 or a more specifically a 204 which is the good thumbs up green thumbs up for deleting all right so let's go into here and go ahead restart it run Swagger and let's check to see if it works so go into here and let's delete a stock that we no longer want in our stock API and I'm going to go with vti I'm I used to be a big vti guy but I kind of have gotten out of bti for real I'm going to go down here and we're going to go ahead and delete it fingers crossed yes I think we're yes 204 undocumented all right let's go so let's also make sure we have our G and bti is no longer there okay that's pretty much it next we are going to move on to acing anyways hope that you guys enjoyed this if you did make sure to smash that like button smash that subscribe button and as always thank you for watching
